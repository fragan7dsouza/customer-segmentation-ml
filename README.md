# ðŸ§  Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)

This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The dataset used is a real-world online retail dataset, and the project walks through data cleaning, feature engineering, clustering, and visualization.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

- Cleans and preprocesses transactional data
- Aggregates customer-level features: Frequency, Quantity, Total Spend
- Applies standard scaling to normalize data
- Uses the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
- Performs K-Means clustering to group customers
- Visualizes the customer segments using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

## ðŸ“Š Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the complete pipeline
- `Online Retail.xlsx`: The dataset used is included as Online Retail.xlsx
- `README.md`: You're reading it ðŸ˜Š

## ðŸ“¸ Sample Outputs

- Elbow Curve to choose k
- PCA scatterplot showing customer clusters

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Unsupervised machine learning with K-Means
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- How to interpret and present clustering results
